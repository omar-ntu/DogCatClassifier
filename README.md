# Dog and Cat Classifier
This was a project done for one of my university modules, "Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining", or what I like to call AIDM for short.

`1_AIDM_FirstAttempt` contains our first attempt at building a classifier and understanding the whole process of it.

`2_AIDM_Cleaned` was a refined version of the first notebook, containing only code that was necessary for the project and building the Dog Cat Classifier.

`3_AIDM_Final` is almost a copy of the cleaned version, just that the code is tweaked a little to meet some of the assignment's requirements.

`AIDM_CIFAR10` contains code to build a similar classifier with almost the same architecture to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

p.s. you'll notice some text in the markdown cells in the notebooks `2_AIDM_Cleaned` and `3_AIDM_Final`. These are texts that I wrote to brief my projectmates on what was going on.
